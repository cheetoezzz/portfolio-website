                    I am a Full Stack Developer with practical experience in freelance development, corporate IT systems, and startup projects. I specialize in building scalable and performance-driven web applications using modern technologies such as React, Node.js, and SQL-based databases.

                    I specialize in JavaScript ecosystems, particularly React and Node.js, but I'm
                    always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks. I believe in writing clean,
                    maintainable code and following best practices in software development.
